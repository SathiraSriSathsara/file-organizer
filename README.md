# File Organizer

This Python script is designed to organize files in a specified folder by grouping them into subfolders based on their file extensions. It can help you tidy up your cluttered download folder or any other directory containing various files.

## How it works

The script iterates through all the files in the specified folder and identifies their file extensions. It then creates subfolders for each unique file extension found and moves the corresponding files into their respective subfolders. If a subfolder for a specific extension already exists, the script will move the files to that existing subfolder.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download or copy the contents of `file_organizer.py` to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `file_organizer.py`.

4. Modify the `folder_path` variable at the end of the script to point to the target folder where you want to organize the files. For example:

   ```python
   folder_path = "C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads"
   ```
5. Run the script:

    ```
    python file_organizer.py
    ```

   The script will start organizing the files in the specified folder.

## Note

- Make sure you have appropriate permissions to modify files and create directories in the specified folder.
